      <h1>High Cost, Low Buzz: The World Expo is Just Around the Corner</h1>
      <p class="subhead">Do We Really Need an Event That Requires Spending $1million on One Toilet?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="byline">

    <p>This summer, the world is buzzing with excitement for the Paris Olympics. Meanwhile, in Japan, construction is steadily progressing 
      towards the World Expo scheduled for 2025. The host city will be in the Kansai region, specifically Osaka. Even though the event is 
      set to start in just 9 months, there is a lack of excitement within Japan. The primary reason for this is the enormous cost.</p>

    <p>The Japanese government and other stakeholders began their bid to host the Expo in 2017. Initially, the estimated cost was set at 
      $823 million (approximately 짜125 billion). However, due to rising material costs and labor expenses, the Japan World Expo 2025 
      Association revised this estimate to $1.23 billion (about 짜185 billion) in November 2020, and again to $1.56 billion (around 짜235 billion) 
      in November 2023. As of May 2024, these figures remain unchanged. Compared to the original plan, this represents an increase of 
      about 1.9 times!

          <p>Naturally, the increased expenditures by the national and local governments have led to taxpayers expressing their frustration.
             A major point of contention is the main facility named 'Ring', a grand roof structure with high construction costs. 
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step2">
        <p>This massive wooden building, one of the largest in the world, will feature a diameter of 675 meters, an outer height of 20 meters, 
          and a 2-kilometer-long pedestrian walkway. Renowned architect Sou Fujimoto is designing the structure, and three of Japan's leading 
          construction companies are each responsible for different sections of the project.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step3">
        <p>Facing significant criticism, a designer and officers from the Japan International Exposition Association 2025 have emphasized 
          the importance of using traditional techniques in construction and the role of key buildings in the overall layout of the venue. 
          They also highlighted the plan to reuse the structures after the Expo's closure. However, the proposed reuse plans remain in limbo, 
          with no clear purpose in sight.
        </p>
      </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Meanwhile, let's compare the construction bids. The chart below lists the winning bid prices for architectural construction of various 
      facilities, including the Theme Pavilions, Reception Hall, Toilets, and Lounges, as announced by the Japan Association for the International 
      Exposition 2025.</p>
    <p>Indeed, when looking at the amounts for each construction project, the grand roof stands out significantly. To be specific, this figure 
      includes gates and ancillary management facilities as well, so the amount dedicated solely to the grand roof across the three sections 
      will be $214 million (approximately 짜34.4 billion).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/18948676"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
      <figcaption>Information on the names of each facility, winning bid amounts, and designers has been compiled. For the Grand Roof, 
        since different construction companies are responsible for different sections, this is also noted in the facility names.
        Hovering over each item will display a label with detailed information.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>However, a different perspective reveals another truth. When dividing the construction costs by the area of each facility, 
      it becomes clear that the grand roof may not be as 'expensive' as it seems. Instead, attention should be focused on one of 
      the theme pavilions. Designed by the world-renowned architectural unit SANAA, this pavilion, despite its small size, 
      turns out to be surprisingly costly.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/18948688"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
      <figcaption>Compared the bid amounts for each facility by dividing them by their respective areas.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Below is an illustration of the pavilion designed by SANAA. While the roof-only structure surrounded by greenery offers 
      a sense of openness, the building's area is relatively small, resulting in a significantly high cost per square meter. 
      In reality, the quantity of materials used is expected to be minimal, I cannot understand how the money is being spent.
    </p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>Similarly, the cost of restrooms appears to be quite high. The construction for what is referred to as 'Restroom 8',
      despite its compact size of 56 square meters, costs $666,000. While the design of small-scale facilities such as 
      restrooms and lounges are being entrusted to young architects as a challenge, there are doubts about whether 
      the validity of these costs has been thoroughly examined.
   </p>
   </div>
  <div class="full-width">

    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>There are other issues lurking as well. For example, despite the unique characteristics and varying materials of 
      each facility, why do the costs align so closely? Additionally, one of the theme pavilions has a situation 
      where no construction company has submitted a bid. Will it truly be ready in time for the opening?
    </p>
    <p>Now, we must consider the purpose of hosting such an expensive World Expo. To understand its significance,
       examining the costs is a good place to start. Comparing past expos held since 2000, the 2010 Shanghai Expo 
       had an exceptionally high number of visitors, while the 2020 Dubai Expo performed well despite the challenges 
       posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>Next, I compared the Profit and Loss, and Economic Impacts based on Japanese government materials and newspaper 
      reports. Since the economic impact of the 2020 Dubai Expo and the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo has not yet been disclosed, 
      I assumed it to be zero. Among these, the 2000 Hannover Expo is often cited as a 'historical failure.' The number of 
      visitors significantly fell short of expectations, resulting in a reported deficit of 2.4 billion marks (approximately $80 million).
    </p>
    <figure>
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/18928847"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </figure>
    <p>Learning from that failure, the 2005 Aichi Expo was held with great caution. While the Aichi Expo did not attract an exceptionally 
      large number of visitors, it ultimately had a financial outcome comparable to the Shanghai Expo, making it a model of success 
      in the expo business.
    </p>
    <p>The financial performance and economic impacts are based on announcements from respective countries and research institutions, 
      and the methods of calculation are not necessarily consistent. However, it is possible to discern certain trends. 
    </p>
    <p>The construction for the Osaka-Kansai Expo has already begun, and it is no longer feasible to cancel or reduce costs at this point. 
      Nonetheless, I believe it is essential to thoroughly examine the costs, benefits, and decision-making processes to question 
      the significance of continuing to host expos in various locations in the future.
