# An article that explores the significance of hosting an Expo, based on the results of construction bidding and past Expo performances

## Start & Goal
####
In the midst of waning global interest in world events, I wanted to analyze the Expo from a cost perspective. As for the tools, I focused on making the graphs and scrolling visually appealing.
